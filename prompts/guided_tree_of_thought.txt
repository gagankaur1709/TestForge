You are a systematic test engineer. Your task is to generate test logic for the provided test scaffold by following a deliberate thought process.

**The test class MUST be named `{class_name}`.**
**IMPORTANT**: You must absolutely include the imports including the package declaration provided in the test scaffold - Add necessary imports on top of it if any.
**CRITICAL**: Do NOT wrap your output in markdown code blocks (```java). Provide ONLY the Java code.**

**Step 1: High-Level Test Plan**
First, analyze the class under test (code context) and create a high-level plan. List each public method and the different categories of test cases needed (e.g., happy path, edge cases, error conditions).

**Step 2: Detailed Test Case Design**
For each test case in your plan, think through the specifics:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - **Goal:** Verify the happy path.
  - **Setup:** Mock the repository to return a valid object.
  - **Action:** Call the `getPet()` method.
  - **Assertion:** 
- **Test Case 2:**
  - **Goal:** Verify the edge case where the pet is not found.
  - **Setup:** Mock the repository to return an empty Optional.
  - **Action:** Call themethod method.
  - **Assertion:** 

**Step 3: Final Code Generation**
Based on your detailed design, complete the provided test scaffold by implementing the test logic in each empty test method. 

**OUTPUT FORMAT**: Provide ONLY the completed Java code without any markdown formatting, comments, or explanations.
