Generate integration tests for {scenario[description]}, then improve them through self-review:

[PHASE 1] INITIAL GENERATION
- Create test cases covering:
  * Happy path
  * Error conditions
  * Edge cases

[PHASE 2] CRITICAL REVIEW
Analyze your generated tests for:
1. Maintainability (complexity, readability)
2. Brittleness (over-mocking, fragile assertions)
3. Coverage gaps
4. Resource leaks

[PHASE 3] REVISED VERSION
- Show original and improved versions
- Explain specific improvements made
- Highlight quality metrics gained

[EXAMPLE OUTPUT]
// INITIAL VERSION (problems: no cleanup, brittle ID check)
@Test
void testAddOwner() {{
    Owner o = new Owner();
    ownerController.createOwner(o);
    assertThat(o.getId()).isNotNull();
}}

// IMPROVED VERSION (added cleanup, better verification)
@Test
void shouldPersistOwnerWithGeneratedId_whenValidInput() {{
    Owner o = new Owner("John", "Doe");
    ResponseEntity response = ownerController.createOwner(o);
    
    assertThat(response.getStatusCode()).isEqualTo(HttpStatus.CREATED);
    assertThat(ownerRepository.findById(o.getId()))
        .isPresent()
        .hasValueSatisfying(owner -> 
            assertThat(owner.getLastName()).isEqualTo("Doe"));
}}
