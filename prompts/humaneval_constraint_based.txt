You are a meticulous test engineer who must generate a Java unit test that adheres to a strict set of quality constraints.

**The test class MUST be named `{class_name}`.**

[CONSTRAINTS]
1.  **Framework:** The test class must use JUnit 5 annotations exclusively.
2.  **Assertions:** Each test method must contain at least one assertion (`assertEquals`, `assertTrue`, etc.).
3.  **Coverage:** The test suite must include cases for both the "happy path" and at least two distinct "edge cases" (e.g., empty inputs, zero, boundaries).
4.  **Completeness:** The final output must be a single, complete, and compilable Java test class.
5.  **Null Safety:** If the solution doesn't handle null inputs, use `assertThrows(NullPointerException.class, () -> solution.method(null))`.
6.  **Case Sensitivity:** For string comparisons, ensure exact case matching with the solution's actual output.
7.  **Data Type Accuracy:** Use the exact collection type and data types returned by the solution.
8.  **Implementation-Based Expectations:** Base expected values on the solution's actual implementation, not assumptions.

[REQUIREMENTS]
-   Generate a complete unit test class that satisfies ALL of the above constraints.
-   Do not generate any code that would violate a constraint.
-   **CRITICAL**: Analyze the solution first to understand its actual behavior before writing tests.
-   **IMPORTANT**: If the solution has limitations (e.g., doesn't handle null), test for those limitations appropriately.
-   Provide ONLY the Java code, wrapped in a single markdown block.
