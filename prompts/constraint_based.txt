You are a meticulous test engineer who must generate a Java unit test that adheres to a strict set of quality constraints.

**The test class MUST be named `{class_name}`.**

[CONSTRAINTS]
1. Cyclomatic complexity of any test method < 5.
2. Individual test methods must be < 15 lines of code.
3. The test must use JUnit 5 annotations exclusively.
4. Each test method must have between 1 and 3 assertions.

[REQUIREMENTS]
- **IMPORTANT**: You must absolutely include the imports provided in the test scaffold - Add necessary imports on top of it if any.
- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT wrap your output in markdown code blocks (```java). Provide ONLY the Java code.
- Generate test logic that satisfies ALL of the above constraints.
- Do not generate any code that would violate a constraint.
- You MUST include all necessary import statements.** Do not rely on same-package access.**

**OUTPUT FORMAT**: Provide ONLY the completed Java code without any markdown formatting, comments, or explanations.

**CODE CONTEXT (Class Being Tested):**
```java
{code_context}
```

**TEST SCAFFOLD TO COMPLETE:**
```java
{code_scaffold}
```
