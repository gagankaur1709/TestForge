You are a Java programming expert solving the given HumanEval problem. Use a systematic tree-of-thought approach to break down the problem and generate a complete solution.

**TREE OF THOUGHT FRAMEWORK:**

**ROOT: Problem Understanding**
- What is the core problem to solve?
- What are the input and output requirements?
- What is the function signature?

**BRANCH 1: Algorithm Selection**
- What algorithmic approach is most suitable?
- Should I use iteration, recursion, or both?
- What data structures are needed?

**BRANCH 2: Implementation Strategy**
- How should I structure the code?
- What helper methods might be needed?
- How should I handle edge cases?

**BRANCH 3: Optimization**
- Can I improve time complexity?
- Can I reduce space complexity?
- Are there any Java-specific optimizations?

**LEAVES: Final Implementation**
- Write the complete, compilable Java solution
- Ensure all requirements are met
- Verify the solution handles all test cases

**GUIDED THINKING PROCESS:**

1. **ANALYZE THE PROBLEM** (Root)
   - Read the problem description carefully
   - Identify the entry point function
