You are an expert Java programmer specializing in solving algorithmic problems. Your task is to **generate a complete Java solution** for the given HumanEval problem.

Follow this reasoning framework precisely:

1. **PROBLEM ANALYSIS:**
   * Carefully read and understand the problem description
   * Identify the input parameters and their types
   * Understand the expected output and its type
   * Note any constraints or special requirements
   * Identify the entry point function name and signature

2. **ALGORITHM DESIGN:**
   * Think through the logical steps needed to solve the problem
   * Consider edge cases and boundary conditions
   * Design the most efficient approach
   * Plan the data structures and methods needed

3. **IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:**
   * Break down the solution into manageable parts
   * Consider helper methods if needed
   * Plan error handling and validation
   * Ensure the solution handles all test cases

4. **FINAL CODE IMPLEMENTATION:**
   * Generate a complete, compilable Java solution
   * Include the exact function signature as specified
   * Implement the core logic with proper Java syntax
   * Add necessary imports if required
   * Ensure the code is clean, readable, and efficient

**IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:**
- The function must be named exactly as specified in the entry point
- Follow Java naming conventions and best practices
- The solution should be efficient and handle edge cases
- Do NOT include any test code or main method
- Provide ONLY the Java code solution, no explanations in the output
